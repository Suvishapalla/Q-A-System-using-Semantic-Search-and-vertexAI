# Q&A-System-using-Semantic-Search-and-vertexAI

This is a brief project to understand semantic search, vertex AI, and text embeddings. I used a dataset from Stack Overflow with 2000 records and converted them into text embeddings. The goal was to compare a user's question with this database. After identifying the closest match using cosine similarity, I applied the VertexAI generation model to generate a relevant answer based on the user's question and the corresponding Stack Overflow answer.
